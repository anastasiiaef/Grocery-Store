# GroceryStore

Introduction
  - Our application will be designed to function as a guide for users looking for a grocery store and looking for what products a store carries. Within our application the user will be able to view a list of products, add their products to a grocery list, and save and delete specific lists/orders that they have created. In addition, the users will be able to search for specific items to see whether or not the store carries a certain item. On top of this users will be able to find the store on a map. Finally, the user will be able to see and save pictures used throughout the app.
